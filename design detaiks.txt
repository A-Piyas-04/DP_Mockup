Below is a clean, structured, mobile-focused list of all essential frontend pages for your IUT Transport System webapp — based on your problem brief (subscriptions, daily tokens, seat availability, payments, drivers, transport officer).
Everything is written so you can directly give this to your UI agent to generate screens.

Smooth cards for lists
Consistent spacing, 12–16px gaps
Primary color: university theme (dark green / navy, whichever IUT uses)
Secondary color: light grey backgrounds
Rounded corners: 12–16px
Buttons: full-width on mobile
Seat map: simplified boxes, not detailed graphics
Charts: lightweight, vertical-bar or line charts only
📌 One-Scroll Summary (Copy-Paste for Agent)
Mobile-first screens required:
Login → Role-based Dashboards (Officer, Driver, Subscriber, User) → Vehicle List + Vehicle Details → Driver List + Profile → Route List + Route Details → Seat Availability → Token Booking → Payment → Payment History → Subscription List + Subscriber Profile → Reports (Daily & Monthly) → Notification Center → Profile & Settings.
Use single-column, card-based UI, rounded corners, consistent spacing, sticky bottom CTAs, simple seat map, color-coded statuses, minimal text, and responsive design.
